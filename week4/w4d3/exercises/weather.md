# Weather Widget

#### Goals
Create an app that displays the local weather. You can select whatever weather conditions you'd like to display: temperature, clouds, sun, rain, etc.

You will need to create an account at [http://openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) to use their API.

Their API docs are [available here](http://openweathermap.org/api).

How might you build this so a user can change the widget using a zip code?
