#### Front End Bonus Project
We will not be covering all of this in the course but if you want to get really good at frontend HTML/CSS, take a crack at building the Tugboat Coffee website (or at least looking through the code that makes it work with Chrome Developer Tools). You can find the tugboat code in the `resources` folder. This is a very involved website that makes use of a lot of CSS tricks to illustrate how they can be used.
