#### Front End Bonus Project
We will not be covering all of this in the course but if you want to get really good at frontend HTML/CSS, take a crack at building the Tugboat Coffee website that is built in the Handcrafted CSS book (linked above). This is a very involved website that makes use of a lot of CSS tricks to illustrate how they can be used. As you will see in our future projects, not all websites have to rely on CSS trickery.
