# Week 1 Day 3: HTML & CSS - Putting it all together

### HTML & CSS Project
For this project, you're going to build your own profile page that can serve as the beginnings of your web development portfolio.

You can design your page to look any way you'd like but for the purpose of exercising the concepts covered, please use all of the following in your page.

Create a new document called `profile.html` to serve as your profile page

For content, please include:  
* Your name
* Include a professional photo of yourself
* Link to your Github profile that we created in our first class
* A list or table of your projects. We don't have any web projects built yet but go ahead and add this course as your first project and we can replace it later.
* Link to any other professional profiles such as LinkedIn or Twitter


For styling, your page must:
* Use an external stylesheet
* Use the `opacity` CSS property somewhere
* Use the `background-image` property to create a background image
* NOT use any inline CSS
* Display your professional photo as a circle (like the example below)
