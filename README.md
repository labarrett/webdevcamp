# Web Development Curriculum

This is the curriculum for Reno Collective Academy's Web Development Bootcamp.

## Getting Started
Welcome to RC Academy, this page will be here as a reference for the course. Each week and day of the class is organized in a folder such as `week1` and `w1d1`. If you'd like to jump straight to the week/day that we are currently working on, you can find it below in the schedule and click on the link.

This is a living document and will be updated frequently. We will be releasing the curriculum every two weeks so you will have the readings, videos, exercises, etc. for the current week as well as the upcoming week.

You might find it difficult to try and do the following week's work. If you do happen to finish the current week's workload and want more practice, please let us know and can provide more exercises or small projects.

## Asking for help

Please do! There are no bad questions, you are encouraged to any questions you have as the course progresses. We might sometimes answer your question with more questions to help you arrive at the answer but that's all part of the learning process!

## Fixes and Changes to the Curriculum
Again, this is going to be a living document for the duration of this class. It has been written specifically for this class and while we've tried to get it right on the first go, there might be some mistakes.

**Did you found typos or broken links?** If we are at the point in the class where you feel ready to use git & Github, you're welcome to make the change and send a pull request or [create an issue]() and we'll get it fixed!
