/*

  1. Create a function called returnGreeting that accepts a name as the argument
  2. Create a variable inside of returnGreeting called 'greeting'
  3. Compute a greeting by using the name argument and something like 'Hello NAME, how are you doing?'
  4. Return the greeting.
  5. Call returnGreeting and pass in your name

  Now if we call this, we won't get anything in the console. The reason is that we are returning the greeting
  instead of using console.log.

  6. Create a new variable OUTSIDE of the returnGreeting function and name it ourGreeting and set it equal
  to our function returnGreeting('Your Name');
  7. Output ourGreeting using console.log.

  You should now be able to see the greeting in the console.
  Think about what is happening here and we will discuss in class.
