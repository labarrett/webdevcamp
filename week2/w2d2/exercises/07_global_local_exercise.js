/*

  Goal: To observe how local and global variables work with function scope.
  1. Create a function called displayBank()
  2. Create  global variable called bankBalance and set it to 10000.
  3. Inside of displayBank, create a new local variable inside of displayBank also called bankBalance and set it equal to 1000000.
  4. Use console.log to display the bankBalance again.
  5. Now call the displayBank functions
  6. Finally, use console.log outside of the displayBank function to display the global bankBalance.
  7. You should have two console.logs with numbers.
