/*
  Write a function named calculateAge that satisfies the following:
    1. takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
    2. calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
    3. outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"

  Call the function three times with different sets of values.

  Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
