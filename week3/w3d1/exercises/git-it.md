# Git-It Workshop

This workshop was created by [@jlord](http://github.com/jlord) on Github to help teach some of the mechanics of git and Github.

### Installing Git-It

Download Git-it-electron from here, make sure you choose darwin for mac and win32 for windows.

[https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases/tag/3.1.0](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases/tag/3.1.0)

Extract the zip file you download and move the folder either to your desktop or your projects folder. Extracting the zip will take a little while on Windows. Now open the folder and run the Git-it.exe (PC) or Git-it app (Mac). If you are on a mac, you will most likely get an error that the app was made by an unidentified developer. Go into System Preferences > Security & Privacy and under the General tab you should see an "Open Anyway" button next to "Git-it could not be opened because....". Go ahead and open that.

Now you can follow the instructions for each step in the workshop and press "verify" to have it check your work.

### Working through the exercises
Read through all the instructions carefully!

### Troubleshooting
There are a couple known issues with the workshop and we are working with the creator to fix them. They will not happen to everyone but if you run into an issue, let us know!

They are most likely to happen with the `remote control` and `forks and clones` exercises.
